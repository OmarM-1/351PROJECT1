Design of Sender and Receiver for IPC
Overview
- Mechanism to process the communication between two processes while both simutaneously running in an OS. 

Sender and Reciever code objective:
- Efficiency
- Scalability
- Security

Sender Design: 
  - Responsible for trasmitting data to the receiver.

  - Data packaging using "struct" and including message size for processing at the receiver end. 
  - Communication tied in with including shared memory for data transfer and message queues for synchonization 
  - Error handling

Receiver Design: 
  - Responsible for processing data from the sender. 

  - msgcrv() takes care of finding the sent messages
  - data parsing allos for the validation of data allowing for correct formatting (e.g. adding '__recv')
  - Using synchonization when accessing shared memory/resources.
  - Error handling

Implementation: 
  - Shared Memory: Allows for fast data transfer
  - Message Queues: Synchonizes communication between both processes 

This design ensures reliability and scalability between two processes.
